## devo struggles

Doing my devos every day is a deeply engrained habit of mine at this point. I can't even really remember the last day when I haven't read my Bible and prayed in recent memory. I genuinely enjoy doing devos and I've experienced wonderful times of communion with God. And yet, there are still days, like today, where it was a struggle to do my devos. I was constantly getting distracted. I was tired and nodding off even though I got enough sleep last night. Maybe it's because I got up at 6:30 today, but I went to sleep at around 10:30 yesteday, so it should have been enough. Or maybe it's because my body was extra tired from swimming so hard yesterday. Whatever it was, I had a hard time staying focused today. I've heard from seasoned Christians, who have been walking with the Lord for many years, that prayer is still a struggle sometimes even for them. It still takes a lot of effort and discipline even with all their years of praying. Perhaps that's just how it is because of the weakness of our flesh. I think I remember David Brainerd also having similar struggles because he often wrote about his time with God.

Once I started giving thanks to God, things started to get easier. Walking around my room also helped. I find that I feel closer to God after I give thanks to Him for all the material and spiritual blessings He has given me. My affections begin to be stirred when I remember all of His goodness and kindness towards me. Maybe I should start my devos with thanksgiving. I'll try that tomorrow and see what happens.
