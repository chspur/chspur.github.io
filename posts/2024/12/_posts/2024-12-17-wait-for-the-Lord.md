## wait for the Lord

As I was praying this morning, my prayer was answered. I don't think I've ever experienced something like that before. God answered my prayer before I even finished praying. I was fighting it for most of the day yesterday and I think I remember praying for God to help me, but it persisted. I woke up still feeling the same this morning, so I took it to the Lord and He answered me in an amazing way. I happily continued my time with God after that and ended up communing with Him for two hours. It was wonderful.

My Bible reading today included Isaiah 49 and I feel like I experienced what Isaiah said at the end of verse 23:

> Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.
