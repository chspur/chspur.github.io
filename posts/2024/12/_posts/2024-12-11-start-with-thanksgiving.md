## start with thanksgiving

Today's devos were better. I started my time by giving thanks and that got me going for the rest of my prayer time. I think I will start with thanksgiving from now on. Psalm 103 and Isaiah 43 really spoke to me and I enjoyed praying those back to God.

Swam 2500 meters today. I did 2100 meters of freestyle in sets of 300 meters and then 400 meters of breastroke in sets of 200 meters. After, I got in the jacuzzi because it was kind of cold outside.

Applied to Esri today. Hopefully, they are willing to take me back.
