## sleep is important

I got eight hours of sleep and had a wonderful time of devos today. I find that the less tired I am in the morning when I do my devos, the better my devo time actually is. I'm able to read and understand the Word more easily. I'm able to pray with more fervency and less distraction. I don't nod off and my mind doesn't wander. It's so interesting because it's so simple and it should be common sense, but I don't think I ever realized that spiritual health is connected, at least in some ways, to physical health. It's the same reason why it's important to get enough sleep the night before the Lord's Day in preparation for worship. Even sins are more easily avoided and temptations more easily withstood when I'm not tired.

My free copy of the MacArthur Study Bible came in the mail today. Probably won't use it, but it was free so I'll take it. Thanks JMac!
