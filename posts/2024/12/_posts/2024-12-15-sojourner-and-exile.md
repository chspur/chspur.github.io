## sojourner and exile

Another excellent sermon today. It was on 1 Peter 2:10-12 and it was very interesting seeing how Peter applies the story of Hosea to Christians in verse 10. Through God's word, I was able to see and savor the beauty of Christ and the wonder of the cross. So thankful that Christ did not receive mercy and was forsaken by God on the cross so that I could receive mercy and be a part of God's people.

I was also reminded today that I am a sojourner and exile in this world. I am a foreigner in this land and this is not my home. This world hates me, just as it hated my master. As a friend of God, I am an enemy of this world. I have renounced my citizenship in this world and my life must reflect that more and more. I must always live as a citizen of heaven. This world has nothing for me!
