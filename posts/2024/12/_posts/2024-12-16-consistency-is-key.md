## consistency is key

These last couple of days I haven't been able to do my devos in the morning like I normally do and the lack of consistency has really thrown me off. I need to do better with sleeping on time so I could wake up early enough to do my devos and finish without feeling rushed. The time I spend with God in the morning is really the most important part of my day and I feel like everything else is thrown off when I don't properly spend that time with Him. Need to get back into my rhythm.

Swam 2100 meters in sets of 300 today.
