## dressrosa

I finished Dressrosa yesterday and I got to say, I think Dressrosa is my favorite arc so far in One Piece. Initially, I had Marineford over it still, but after watching the ending, I'll give it to Dressrosa even though Marineford is a close second. So many great things about the arc. The fights were great. Gear 4 was hype. All the loveable new characters, as well as old faces reappearing, made the arc more interesting. Doflamingo and the Donquixote family were the coolest antagonists and my favorite so far out of any arc. Fujitora and Sabo were exciting to watch. Law and Rosinante, Pica's voice, god Usopp and his fight with Sugar were highlights for sure. The forming of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet was a nice touch at the end. Overall, the arc was very impactful not only for me, but also for the story itself. I'm sure I'll see many of the effects and characters from Dressrosa in future arcs, which I'm definitely looking forward to.

Today's sermon was great. I loved being reminded that we are a holy priesthood and our duty is to offer spiritual sacrifices to God as His priests. These spiritual sacrifices are prayer, praise, holy living and service, and financial giving. I especially liked the part where P Dan explained that our prayers are like incense rising up to God through Christ because it motivated me to be more diligent in my prayer life. I'm also grateful that we have such free and privileged access to God now under the new covenant. I can go into the Most Holy Place anytime and be in the presence of holy God. It's truly amazing, and I pray that I will treasure and make use of this benefit more and more in my life.
