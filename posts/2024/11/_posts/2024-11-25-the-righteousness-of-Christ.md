## the righteousness of Christ

One of my favorite quotes. It reminds me that my standing with God does not depend on my own righteousness, but only on Christ's perfect and immutable righteousness.

> I saw, moreover, that it was not my good frame of heart that made my righteousness better, nor my bad frame that made my righteousness worse; for my righteousness was Jesus Christ himself, the same yesterday and today and forever.

-John Bunyan, *Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners*
