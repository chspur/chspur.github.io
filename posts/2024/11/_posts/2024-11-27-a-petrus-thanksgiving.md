## a petrus thanksgiving

Drove to UCSD today with Dad to pick up Petrus. There was a lot of traffic, but it was fun.

UCSD is permanently under construction lol. They are currently rebuilding Marshall.

First time inside the SD Supercomputer Center. Dad works here sometimes and we got our gas paid for by checking in here. Perks of the job.

Ate dinner at Class 302 in Irvine before heading home. Pretty good.
