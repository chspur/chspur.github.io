## thankful for God

Today is Thanksgiving and I read Psalm 84 in my devotional time this morning. Verses 10-12 stood out to me:

> <sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness. <sup>11</sup> For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly. <sup>12</sup> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you!

I'm so thankful that someone as sinful as me is able to be in God's presence, to be in His courts and His house. I'm so thankful that I have the blessing of trusting in God and that I can receive His favor, honor, and goodness. God is my highest good and I'm so thankful that I have Him because of Christ. I pray that I will never forget His kindness to me.

        <i>This is what my family ate for dinner. We always eat hot pot for Thanksgiving instead of a typical Thanksgiving dinner, which in my opinion is definitely an upgrade.</i>
