## psalm 119

Whenever I read Psalm 119, I'm always stunned by the psalmist's profound love and desire for God's word. He has such a deep longing to know God's word, to keep His commandments, and to trust His promises. He truly treasures the word of God and sees obedience to God as a great blessing. My prayer is that God would make me like the author of Psalm 119 and that I would have the same heart for God's word as him.

I also read Matthew 4 today. What Christ said in response to Satan's attacks, quoting the OT, fits nicely with Psalm 119:

> Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.

More than the psalmist, my prayer is that I would be like Christ. Without doubt, He was the only one who ever truly embodied Psalm 119.
