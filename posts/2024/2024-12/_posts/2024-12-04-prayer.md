## prayer

I finished *Prayer* by Tim Keller today. It was a solid treatment of the theology of prayer while also offering practical guidance on how to actually pray as well. The two chapters on meditation and the experiential reality of prayer were my favorites. I also really liked how Keller often brought in what others in church history have said about prayer, such as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, John Owen, and C. S. Lewis. Their insights were excellent and very helpful. Shoutout my guy Elias for lending me this book that helped to deepen my prayer life.

During my swim today, I was able to do 300 meter sets the entire time so I think I'll be able to do 300 meter sets from now on.

I also got a response for one of my job applications this morning. I moved to the next stage of the hiring process and they want me to take a cognitive and personality assessment. Grateful and hopefully it turns into something.
