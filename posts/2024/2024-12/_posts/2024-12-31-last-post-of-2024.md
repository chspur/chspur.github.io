## last post of 2024

Today is the last day of 2024. It's crazy because this time last year I was heading back to Guatemala. It feels like that happened so long ago, but I guess a lot has changed since then. 

We had a New Year's Eve service at church tonight. This was the first time I've been at a church that does a New Year's Eve service, so that was pretty cool. It was basically just like a normal Lord's Day service.

Not sure, but hopefully I'll still be posting on here when 2026 rolls around.
