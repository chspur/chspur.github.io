## jellies

Today we went to the aquarium again and finished exploring the sections we didn't get to yesterday. The jellyfish exhibit was the coolest. There were many types of jellyfish, but my favorite were the sea nettles and the moon jellies. Before we left, I bought a hat from the aquarium store. Overall, I think the Monterey Bay Aquarium is the best aquarium of the ones I've been to. They have interesting exhibits, the facility is top-tier, and it's great that they focus a lot of their efforts on research and conservation. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded.
