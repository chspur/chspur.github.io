## aquarium christmas trip

Today was the start of our trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. We drove six hours, but fortunately it didn't feel that long. Dad drove most of it, but I drove for two hours towards the end. During the drive, we passed by a lot of fields and some hills of grass as far as the eye could see. The grass was brownish and dead-looking, but it felt like I was in Kansas and the Great Plains. Not that I've ever been to those places, but that's kind of what it looks like in my mind. There were a lot of black cows freely grazing in the fields and hills, giving us a peaceful and relaxing landscape to look at as we drove. As I was taking in the scene, it reminded me of the Bible's description of the new heavens and the new earth. One day, I will be like a sheep grazing in the endless and beautiful green pastures of God's kingdom.  

We are staying at a super nice hotel, so we explored a little after we ate ramen together in Mom and Dad's room. Tomorrow will be the first day at the aquarium. People say that this aquarium is very nice, so I'm looking forward to it.

Grateful that we could celebrate "God with us" today as a family.
