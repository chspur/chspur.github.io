## an undying love

Today was the last Lord's Day of the year. P Dan was preaching from Ephesians 6:24 on what a dying and undying love for Christ looks like. He reminded us that a dying or a fleeting love for Christ is marked by a love for the world in the heart. Worldliness, friendship with the world, a preference for the world's mindset towards life and the world's purpose for your life is what kills love for Christ in the heart. Love for this present world and love for Christ are mutually exclusive.

He then explained that an undying love for Christ is characterized by a love for Christ Himself over the gifts and blessings that He gives providentially. There are five things to routinely check on in one's loves for Christ:

1. Is Christ's person lovely to you like a husband is lovely to a bride?
2. Is your chief reason for loving Christ that Christ loved you first?
3. Do you yearn or eagerly long for the return of Jesus Christ?
4. Do you find that the commandments of God are not burdensome or unpleasant?
5. Is Christ daily more precious to you than anything else?

My prayer is that I would have an undying love for Christ, that I would never outlive my love for Him.
