## new and old friends

GMC had a YA Christmas party today. It was fun. There was food, games, and a gift exchange. I got a mug, hairclip, and candle from the gift exchange. After, I went to our class hangout at Diane's house. We went out for Mexican food and I got some quesadillas, which were really good. I had a good time talking to people and playing games with them. It was nice seeing them again.
