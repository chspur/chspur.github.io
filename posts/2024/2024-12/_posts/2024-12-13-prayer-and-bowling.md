## prayer and bowling

Prayer meeting was great today. We went bowling after and I managed to break 100 on our second game.

There was also a funny moment where all of us scored 9 points on our first frame.

Only swam 2000 meters this morning. My head started hurting in the middle of my swim, so I took it easy after that. I did 1500 freestyle and 500 breastroke.
