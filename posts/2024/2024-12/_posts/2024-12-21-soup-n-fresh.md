## soup n fresh

Went to Soup 'n Fresh today with Nathan. This was my third time going and I feel like it's just alright. It's not as good as Souplanation was and I'm not sure why because it's basically the same thing. There was a lot of people though, but we got in pretty quick. The strat is definitely to get there thirty minutes before it opens like we did today.
