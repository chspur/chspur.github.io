## small headache

Swam 2100 meters in sets of 300 today. There was a lot of people at the pool because the kids are on Christmas break and they had swim practice. I didn't get that much sleep last night, so after my swim I was pretty tired and had a small headache the whole day.

I was going to hang out with Chen this afternoon, but then we just decided to play some League instead. He fell asleep though, so we ended up playing at night.
