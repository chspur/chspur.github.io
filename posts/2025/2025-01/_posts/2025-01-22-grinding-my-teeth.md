## grinding my teeth

Went to the dentist today for my routine teeth cleaning. I go about every six months. Turns out I grind my teeth a lot in my sleep, so I have to get a night guard. If someone were to watch me sleep, I wonder if they could hear me grinding my teeth. I certainly can't tell while I'm sleeping because I had no idea.
