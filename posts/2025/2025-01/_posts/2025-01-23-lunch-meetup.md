## lunch meetup

Today, I had lunch with P Dan. Originally, I was going to have dinner with him before I took my membership vows, but he was feeling a little sick that day, so we moved our meal to today. I enjoyed chatting with him as usual. We talked about some personal things, like job searching and family, and I also got to ask him some theological questions about sabbath and church government.

After, I went to Barnes and Nobles and I bought the omnibus edition of the first three volumes of One Piece. I'm not planning on getting all of them, I just thought it be cool to have the first book. If I do end up collecting, I'll probably buy the box sets, but that's a conversation for after I get a job.
