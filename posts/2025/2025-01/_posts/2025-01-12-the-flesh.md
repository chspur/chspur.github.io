## the flesh

Today, P Dan preached an excellent sermon on 1 Peter 2:11. I need to wage war on the flesh because it is waging war on my soul. The flesh is trying to destroy my soul with its passions. If I give in to the passions of the flesh, it will destroy my fruitfulness, communion with God, joy and peace, Christlikeness, and, ultimately, it will keep me from inheriting heaven.

After worship and lunch, I was sitting in the church cafe reading my book and P Dan came up to me and we started talking. I think it's so cool that at GMC the pastors are so approachable and that they are even willing to approach me. I think it helps that the congregation is pretty small and also that P Dan and I have similar interests, such as reading solid Christian books. He told me how he's been reading a lot of J. C. Ryle since he got the entire J. C. Ryle set from Banner of Truth for Christmas. We also talked about the Puritans since I was reading a book written by a Puritan.
