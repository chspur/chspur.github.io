## members meeting

Today was my first members meeting at church. There was an overview of the events that are tentatively planned for this year, as well as the church budget. Then, P Dan talked about a change in one of the church bylaws regarding the qualification for ruling elders. They are removing the qualification for ruling elders to be ordained deacons or elders in order to comply with the PCA. It was nice being a part of the meeting and I was able to learn something new.
