## quesadillas and tea

Went to hang out with Chen today in Fullerton. We went to Tacos Los Cholos for dinner and then a tea shop called Vivot Cafe. It was fun and we had some solid conversations, which I'm very thankful for.

I got an adobada quesadilla and an asada quesadilla. They were really yummy with lots of meat.

Chen has Yelp Elite, so we got this for free. It was like a tea sampler type of thing.
