## cars, books, and projects

This morning I took my car to Pep Boys for some maintenance. It was pretty chill, just like an oil change and tire rotation.

Bought three new books on Amazon: *Creeds, Confessions, and Catechisms* by Chad Van Dixhoorn and the two volume set of *The Complete Works of E. M. Bounds On Prayer*.

Continued working on my CRC. I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically sync my repo with the S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront cache.
