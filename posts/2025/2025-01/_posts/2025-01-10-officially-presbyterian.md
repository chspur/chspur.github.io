## officially presbyterian

We had prayer meeting at church tonight. Before the prayer meeting, I took my membership vows with P Dan and officially became a member of GMC. I am now officially a Presbyterian and a member of the PCA. Very excited because becoming a Presbyterian was definitely a long time coming for me. Technically, this also marks the first time I've been a member of a local church since all my previous churches did not do membership, so that's cool.
