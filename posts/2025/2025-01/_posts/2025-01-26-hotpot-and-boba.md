## hotpot and boba

After service today, we had a congregational meeting for this year's budget and to change one of the church bylaws. A lot of it was in Korean, with only some translation, so I didn't understand much. I knew roughly what was going on though because P Dan had already explained most of it last week and because his wife, Angela, was sitting next to me and translating some of it.

After, I ate lunch with Chen and Jonk at a hotpot place in Walnut. It was extra satisfying because it was a cold and rainy day. It was the first time I've been to a place where you pay by weight for how much food you get, so you can get as much or as little as you want. We went to this fancy boba place nearby after.

Chen and Jonk were concerned for me because I didn't get any veggies.

The boba shop's branding was pretty cool.
