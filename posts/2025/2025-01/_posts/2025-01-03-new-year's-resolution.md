## new year's resolution

There was a ton of people at The Claremont Club today when I went swimming. It was the first time I couldn't find a spot in the parking lot and had to park along the street. Maybe a lot of people's New Year's resolution is to lose weight or to work out more consistently this year.

My New Year's resolution is to finish memorizing the Westminster Shorter Catechism. I'm currently on Question 38 and there's 107 questions in total, so I have to do one to two questions a week to finish by the end of the year. Shouldn't be too hard, I just need to stay consistent.
