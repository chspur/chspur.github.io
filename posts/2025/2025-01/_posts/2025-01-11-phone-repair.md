## phone repair

I broke the glass covering the camera on my phone, so I tried to get that fixed today. They said it's too arduous of a fix, so they are just going to reimburse me instead, which means that I'll probably get a new phone soon.

Starting today, I've incorporated the Chalcedonian Definition into my daily reading rotation.
