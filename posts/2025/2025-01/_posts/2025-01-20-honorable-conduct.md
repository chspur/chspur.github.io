## honorable conduct

Yesterday, P Dan preached on 1 Peter 2:12-17 and one of his points was that God uses our honorable conduct for the conversion of sinners. During small groups after, one of the discussion questions was to give an example of God using someone's holy life to bring another to faith in Christ. I had a hard time thinking of an example, but when I was driving back from the Claremont Club today I thought of something similar. God constantly uses the lives of faithful saints to sanctify me and encourage me in my walk with Him. I think of Hebrews 11, the Reformers, the Puritans, and other saints in history that have motivated me to follow God more faithfully. It's interesting that I didn't think of this sooner because before I went to church yesterday, I was doing my devotions in Acts 7 and praying that God would make me more like my namesake.

I swam 2100 meters in sets of 300 today. I'm not sure why, but it hasn't been getting easier and I was really tired during my swim.
