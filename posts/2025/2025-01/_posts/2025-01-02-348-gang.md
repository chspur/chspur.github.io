## 348 gang

Chen and Trung got back from their road trip today, so we all got lunch together in Rowland Heights, including Jonk. Chen officially moved back from Texas and is going to be living in Fullerton. I was supposed to go on the road trip with them and help Trung move Chen back to California, but I had the aquarium trip with my family. After lunch, Jonk went to help Chen move into his new crib and I drove Trung back to his house in Signal Hills. He showed me around his house and also the surrounding area. He lives on a hill and there's a park close to his house where you can see really far out. It was a super cool view. Trung also took me to his favorite boba place and we got drinks and some popcorn chicken. Then, I drove back to Rancho and got dinner with Chen, who needed to drive back to drop Jonk off and pick up some more stuff from his house. It was really nice seeing them again and I had a great time catching up with them. The 348 gang is not too far away from each other, so hopefully we can do this again soon.
