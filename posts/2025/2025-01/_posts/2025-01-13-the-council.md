## the council

I was pretty tired today because we had a spontaneous council meeting last night and I ended up sleeping really late. Ellie randomly called me and she told me that she and Diane were calling, so they decided to bring me in. We were already thinking of setting up a call some time, so it was nice that it worked out that way. Now that we are all out of the trenches and busy with our own stuff, we don't really call anymore, so it was cool to convene the council again.
