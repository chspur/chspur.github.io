## power outage

There is a power outage right now as I am writing this. The last time I experienced a power outage I was living in a remote village in Guatemala. I looked outside my window and the whole neighborhood is dark, including the street lights. It's been extremely windy all day today, so I'm guessing that's why there is no power. Hoping it comes back soon.
