## whole cake island

I finished the Whole Cake Island saga a couple of days ago. Whole Cake Island is an S tier arc in my opinion and I put it at #4 for best arcs. I really like how Oda used the characters from the main cast who weren't in Dressrosa for Whole Cake Island, so that everyone gets equal screen time. Since not all the Straw Hats were there, it allowed for other characters to be featured too, such as Pedro, Carrot, and the Firetank Pirates, which I thought was really cool. My two favorite scenes were definitely Sanji vs Luffy and the part in the Katakuri fight where Luffy and Katakuri both use Conqueror's Haki at the same time, maxing out Flampe and her cronies.
