## first post of 2025

Went swimming as usual today. There were a lot less people because it's New Year's. Swam 2100 meters in sets of 300. It was less tiring than Monday, but not back to normal yet.

Doing the daily coding challenge on LeetCode starting today. We'll see how long I can keep up my streak. Hopefully, I'll be able to get a few badges at least.
