## tuesday swim

I usually only swim on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so today was the first time in a while where I swam two days in a row. I went today because I can't swim this Wednesday and because there was a scheduled power outage today anyway, so might as well. I went with Mom and I did my standard 2100 meters in sets of 300. I thought it would be really hard since I also swam yesterday, but it wasn't too bad. After, we went to a dumpling place for lunch.

I started on the second volume of Spurgeon's sermons today and finished sermon #54. I want to start reading one sermon a day again.
