## the secret of power

I'm currently reading the Complete Works of E. M. Bounds on Prayer and this is an excellent quote that motivates me to pursue the Lord.

> Holiness energizing the soul, the whole man aflame with love, with desire for more faith, more prayer, more zeal, more consecration—this is the secret of power.

— E. M. Bounds, *Power Through Prayer*
