## true religion

I was praying today using *The Valley of Vision* and I was really blessed by the prayer that I happened to be on. It was titled *True Religion* and I had a wonderful time praying it back to the Lord.

> LORD GOD ALMIGHTY,<br>
> I ask not to be enrolled amongst the earthly great and rich, but to be numbered with the spiritually blessed.<br>
> Make it my present, supreme, persevering concern to obtain those blessings which are spiritual in their nature, eternal in their continuance, satisfying in their possession.<br>
> Preserve me from a false estimate of the whole or a part of my character;<br>
> May I pay regard to my principles as well as my conduct, my motives as well as my actions.<br>
> Help me never to mistake the excitement of my passions for the renewing of the Holy Spirit, never to judge my religion by occasional impressions and impulses, but by my constant and prevailing disposition.<br>
> May my heart be right with thee, and my life as becometh the gospel.<br>
> May I maintain a supreme regard to another and better world, and feel and confess myself a stranger and a pilgrim here.<br>
> Afford me all the direction, defence, support, and consolation my journey hence requires, and grant me a mind stayed upon thee.<br>
> Give me large abundance of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus, that I may be prepared for every duty, love thee in all my mercies, submit to thee in every trial, trust thee when walking in darkness, have peace in thee amidst life's changes.<br>
> Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief and uncertainties.<br>
