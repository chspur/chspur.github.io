## space-time smackdown

The new Pokemon TCG Pocket expansion came out today at 10PM. At first, I couldn't even get into the game because so many people were on it. Even after I got in, it was still pretty laggy. Eventually, it got better and I opened some packs with Chen, but I didn't get anything good. We used the new trade feature though and he traded me an Arcanine EX, which was the last card I needed to complete the Genetic Apex normal card set.

Swam 2100 meters in sets of 300 as usual. It's been pretty cold these days, so it feels really nice getting into the jacuzzi after. The pool is heated, so you can even see the steam rising from the pool on some days because of how cold it is.
