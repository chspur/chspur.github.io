## unction

Until now, I thought that the main difference between good and bad preaching was the content of the sermon. I thought that the primary difference between powerful preaching and impotent preaching was how biblical the content of the sermon was. While that is an important aspect, I'm beginning to realize that the real difference between good and bad preaching, powerful and impotent preaching, is unction. Unction is power. Unction is what makes real preaching. Unction is what makes preaching divine. Unction is what makes a sermon pierce the heart and convict the conscience. It is what moves me and sets me aflame. It dawned on me, as I was reading E. M. Bounds, that the true reason why I have listened to so many sermons that have not moved me in the slighest is because they did not have unction, they did not have the annointing of the Holy Spirit.
