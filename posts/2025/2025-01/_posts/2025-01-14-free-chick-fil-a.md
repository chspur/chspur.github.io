## free chick-fil-a

At BSF today, we got free Chick-fil-A because our teaching leader is the manager of a Chick-fil-A in Hawaii. I think his Chick-fil-A is the only one in the whole state. Usually, he teaches our class through zoom, but he was here visiting in person today, so we had a special celebration. I was able to get two chicken sandwiches because there was extra. It was yummy and I'm grateful for the free food.
