## children's catechism

We started going through the Children's Catechism in CM today. The plan is to do two questions each week. I'm very glad that we are doing this, even if it's just reading the questions and answers with the kids without much explanation. I'm going to try and explain it a little more, especially once we get to the harder questions. Since I have the older kids in my small group, we will definitely go more in depth there.

P Dan also preached an excellent sermon on 1 Peter 5:8-11 on Satan and how to defeat him, both defensively and offensively. It was an important reminder and encouraged me to be more watchful.
