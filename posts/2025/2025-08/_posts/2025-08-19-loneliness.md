## loneliness

Was reading *You Must Read* and got to John MacArthur's endorsement of Iain Murray's biography of Martyn Lloyd-Jones. It was surprising and intriguing to me that ML-J felt lonely.

I thought that once I left my old church and began attending a Reformed church I would feel less lonely. I thought I would meet many people who had the same theological convictions and drive that I have. I have met some and I am very grateful for them, but unfortunately most of the people I've met are the same as before for the most part.
