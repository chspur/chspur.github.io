## question 60

Question 60 of the Heidelberg Catechism is awesome and a true comfort to the soul.

> Q. How are you righteous before God?
>
> A. Only by true faith in Jesus Christ. Even though my conscience accuses me of having grievously sinned against all Godâ€™s commandments, of never having kept any of them, and of still being inclined toward all evil, nevertheless, without any merit of my own, out of sheer grace, God grants and credits to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, as if I had never sinned nor been a sinner, and as if I had been as perfectly obedient as Christ was obedient for me.&mdash;if only I accept this gift with a believing heart.
