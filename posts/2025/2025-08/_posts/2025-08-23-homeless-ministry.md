## homeless ministry

Went to homeless ministry today in the morning. P John preached a short gospel message in Spanish, which was pretty cool to see. Saw some of the people I met last time I went and was able to continue getting to know them.

I finished two books: *You Must Read* and *The Autobiography of George Muller*. Both were good, but the *Autobiography* really challenged me to believe in the power of prayer. My prayer is that I can be a man of faith and prayer like George Muller.
