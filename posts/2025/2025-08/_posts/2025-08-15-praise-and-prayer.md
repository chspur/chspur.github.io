## praise and prayer

We had praise and prayer night with the little ones today. For dinner, we had Chick-Fil-A nuggets, fruit, and chips. I love listening to the children sing and watching them pray. I earnestly pray that they would receive and rest on Christ for their salvation. After, the CM teachers went out for boba. It was nice getting to hang out with them.

When I got home, I played some League with the 348 gang. Sleeping pretty late tonight.
