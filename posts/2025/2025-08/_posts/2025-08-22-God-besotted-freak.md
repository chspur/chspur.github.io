## God-besotted freak

Was watching an episode of the *Ask Pastor John* podcast and he said something that really caught my attention:

> And I want to invite, frankly, all Christians to join me in this pursuit of greater purity of heart and mind. In our day, when entertainment media is virtually the lingua franca of the world, this is an invitation to be an alien. And I believe with all my heart that what the world needs is radically bold, sacrificially loving, God-besotted freaks, aliens.
>
> In other words, I am inviting you to say no to the world for the sake of the world. The world does not need more cool, hip, culturally savvy, irrelevant copies of itself. That’s a hoax that thousands of young Christians have been duped by. They’ve got to be hip, cool, savvy, culturally aware, watching everything in order not to be freakish, and that is undoing them morally and, I think, for their witness.

I often get the feeling that people think I'm weird, maybe even a freak or an alien if I can go so far as to say that. They don't seem to see life the way I do, even though they are Christians themselves. They don't seem to understand why I live the way I do or, maybe more accurately, why I don't live the way they do. Maybe it's just all in my head, but I really don't think so. I feel quite different from the people around my age.

That's why hearing what Pastor John said was an encouragement to me. It also reminded me about what Paul Washer said about how godliness starts with what you don't do and that you have to be comfortable with being alone. Reading about how ML-J felt lonely the other day also strengthened my spirits. Praying that God will make me a radically bold, sacrifically loving, God-besotted freak.
