## seek first the kingdom

A great reminder by George Muller from his *Autobiography*. I'm always so impressed by his faith, even though he often reminds us that we should not admire him or be astonished by his faith or think he is an amazing person since the Lord is his boast.

> Do you make it your primary business and your first great concern to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness? Are the things of God, the honor of His name, the welfare of His church, the conversion of sinners, and the profit of your own soul, your chief aim? Or does your business, your family, or your own temporal concerns primarily occupy your attention? Remember that the world will pass away, but the things of God will endure forever. I never knew a child of God who acted according to the above passage for whom the Lord did not fulfill His promise, "All these things shall be added unto you."
