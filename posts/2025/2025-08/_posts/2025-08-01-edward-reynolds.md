## edward reynolds

Started the first volume of the works of Edward Reynolds today. My goal is to read all six volumes of his works. It's going to be quite the marathon, but I'm sure I will be greatly edified by it. The first treatise is titled *The Vanity of the Creature* and it has already been a good reminder for me in many ways.
