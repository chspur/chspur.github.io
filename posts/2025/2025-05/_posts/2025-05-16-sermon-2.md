## sermon 2

Finished sermon 2 of *Grace and Glory* today. It was a very profound and insightful sermon on the Sermon on the Mount.

Had some more theological discussion at work today. It was focused mostly on free will and election. My coworkers are great discussion partners and I'm grateful that we are able to civilly disagree with each other.
