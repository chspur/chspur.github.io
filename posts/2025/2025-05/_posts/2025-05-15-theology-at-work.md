## theology at work

I had an extended coversation about theology today at work with one of my coworkers. We had some back and forth about Calvinism and speculated about the cause of Satan's fall. My coworker had some interesting arguments. It's kind of funny because we spent our entire lunch break talking about it and then another thirty minutes after lunch talking about it too.
