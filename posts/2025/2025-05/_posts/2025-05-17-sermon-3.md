## sermon 3

Finished sermon 3 of *Grace and Glory*. The sermon was on Luke 19:10 and the story of Zacchaeus. Here's a great quote from the sermon:

> It is with this as it is with the Pauline statement: no more than one can say, 'Who loved me and gave himself for me,' is it possible to say, 'Who sought me and saved me,' except by a profound faith in the elective purpose as the ultimate cause of the personal inheritance of salvation.

I also bought some more books yesterday, as well as some Funko Pops today.
