## applying the gospel

Today, P Dan preached an excellent gospel sermon on 1 Peter 4:1-2. He reminded us of what the gospel message is and how we ought to apply it to our lives, namely, by constant meditation on the gospel. When we are doing this correctly, the result is a life characterized by a hatred for sin and a love for righteousness.

After church, I finished sermon 4 of *Grace and Glory*. I also continued working on memorizing the Shorter Catechism. I have been slacking a bit, so I was mostly reviewing Questions 1-38 to catch myself back up to speed.
