## air purifier

My new air purifier came in today. Hopefully, it helps reduce the amount of dust in my room. I hate dust, especially ever since I came back from Guatemala because my room when I was living there was so dusty all the time. It was an old building and it wasn't sealed that well, so there was constantly stuff coming into my room.
