## church history and other traditions

Recently, I've been reading and buying a lot of books about church history and other Christian traditions. I'm currently reading the CCC and *Church History in Plain Language*, and I also got a few more books in the mail today on the Apostolic fathers, the Apocrypha, and the Nicene Creed. This is quite new for me because I mostly read in the Reformed tradition, but Gavin Ortlund and Peter have definitely peaked my interest in the early church, church history, and other Christian traditions.
