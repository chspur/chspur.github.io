## farewell pastor kenny

Today we had a farewell party for P Kenny. There was a time of open mic sharing for anyone who wanted to share something about P Kenny or say some last words. Many people were crying and it was a beautiful time of celebration and farewell.

We had tacos for dinner, which were delicious. I happened to be sitting near both P Dan and P Justin, so I asked both of them how they decided to go into full-time ministry. I got some good answers and I will continue to sit on it to see if this desire is truly of God.

Today was also my first time shadowing the children's ministry. I was in the elementary school class, which is also what I did back at Kairos. The kids act very similarly, which makes sense because they are the same age. I think they were much better behaved though. I also really liked that they had a time for giving during worship. It's important to build that habit when they are young. We don't even do that during the adult service!
