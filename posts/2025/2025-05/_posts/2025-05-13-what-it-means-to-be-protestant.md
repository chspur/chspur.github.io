## what it means to be protestant

Today I finished Gavin Ortlund's book titled *What It Means to Be Protestant*. I learned a lot about Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and even church history more generally. I now have a better understanding of the problems with RC and EO and why Protestantism is a more biblical, historical, and catholic alternative.
