## mother's day

Today was Mother's Day and we kind of celebrated yesterday when we went out to lunch with Mom, but today Dad and I got her some flowers. Dad bought his from Trader Joe's and I got some from church that I brought back for her. She put them in a vase on our dinner table. Very grateful for the mother that God gave me.

I also helped with serving lunch at church today. It was hectic, but I was very happy to be able to help
