## teacher steve

Officially started as a teacher today for children's ministry. It was Skit Sunday today and we recreated 1 Samuel 7. It was very fun and I enjoyed watching them act, as well as participating in the skit with them.

After church, Chen, Jonk, and I went to this special sushi place. The sushi had tofu skin wrapped around it, which I've never seen before, but it was so good. Then, we went to Jonk's favorite tea place. I got a popcorn milk tea, which I've also never seen before, but it was pretty good.
