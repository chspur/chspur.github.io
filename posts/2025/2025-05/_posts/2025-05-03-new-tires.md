## new tires

Went to Costco today to get some new tires for my car. My parents also did some grocery shopping and I bought a slice of pizza from the food court because I wasn't full from lunch.

Been reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church and learning a lot. Something I learned is that, for them, Sacred Scripture, sacred Tradition, and the Magisterium are inseperable and all necessary for the Catholic faith.
