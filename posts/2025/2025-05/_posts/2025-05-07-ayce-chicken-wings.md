## ayce chicken wings

After work, I went swimming and then I drove to Buffalo Wild Wings to get dinner with some of the guys from church. We got ayce wings, which was a special that we wanted to try. I don't know if I've ever been to Buffalo Wild Wings, but it was pretty good. We also got to watch the NBA playoffs while we were there. Nuggets lost to the Thunder by 40 points, absolutely ridiculous.
