## the last hoorah

The council hung out in person today in San Diego. Ellie was still around after Diane's wedding and we also had Memorial Day off, so it worked out perfectly. We went to this burger place called The Food Box where the menu items were named after Christian pastors and theologians. The food was decent; we mostly just wanted to go because the names were cool. After, we hung out at the beach for a little, picked up some stuff from Petrus's dorm, went to get some boba, and then we drove home. We didn't do that much, but I really enjoyed just being able to talk with them. It's probably one of the last times the council will be able to meet in person, at least for a while.
