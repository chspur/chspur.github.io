## grace and glory

It was very hot today. The only thing good about that is that it made getting in the pool feel great. I think we are going to get a lot more hot days from here on out. We are definitely in summer.

Now that I'm finished with Calvin's sermons on Ephesians, the next big project I'm starting is *Grace and Glory* a collection of sermons by Geerhardus Vos. I finished the first sermon today. He is a tough read, but very insightful and poetic. His vast learning and intellect definitely comes through in his sermons. The first sermon was an excellent sermon on God's gift of the fruition of Himself.
