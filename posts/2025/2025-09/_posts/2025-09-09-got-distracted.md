## got distracted

My order from RHB came in today. Usually, Tuesdays are one of the days when I get more reading done, but today I got distracted by my new books. I started reading *William the Baptist*, which is a book on the proper mode of baptism. It's told in the form of a story so it makes for an entertaining read.
