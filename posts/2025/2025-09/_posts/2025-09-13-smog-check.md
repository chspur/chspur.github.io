## smog check

Mom and I took my car in for a smog check. It didn't take too long. After, we drove to Wing Stop to pick up the order that Dad placed for lunch. When we got there, the dude said that none of the employees were here yet, but that they were on their way. We decided to wait and we watched the employees arrive. Got our food not too long after and it was delicious.
