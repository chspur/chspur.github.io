## resolutions

Today I turned 24 years old. I first started trying to live by these resolutions when I was 22 being inspired by John Piper. I renew these resolutions each year on my birthday (though I really should be reminding myself of them more often). These are the resolutions I make before God to shape my twenties and beyond, however long God permits me to live.

1. I will read my Bible every day of my life. If I have time to eat or sleep, I will never say that I don’t have time for God’s word. I won’t get my Bible-reading pleasure from the fact that my conscience is clear when the Bible box is checked. I will get my pleasure from the living, supernatural encounter with God-revealed reality in Scripture.

2. I will become as Bible-saturated as I can, putting myself under the influence of the most insightful Bible-teachers, dead and alive.

3. I will find a Bible-believing, Bible-preaching, Bible-structured, Bible-obedient church. I will join it, serve it, discover my gifts, and be accountable to the community as I follow God’s call.

4. I will live as a Christian Hedonist. I won't aim at fame. I won’t aim at sexual gratification. I won’t aim at wealth. I won’t aim at safety. I will aim at all-satisfying joy in God which will empower me for humility, chastity, simplicity, and risk-taking, sacrificial love.

5. I will pray that my future spouse will be a radical, risk-taking, go-anywhere-for-Jesus world Christian.

6. I will recognize that I'm not my own, that I've been bought with a price, and that I belong, body and soul, to Jesus Christ for his use and his glory in this world. I will offer myself up to God and tell him that he may do with me anything he pleases, at any time he pleases, anywhere he pleases. I will memorize Psalm 25, pray it as my own, give myself wholly up to God and His mission, and trust Him.

And as Jonathan Edwards said, "Being sensible that I am unable to do anything without God’s help, I do humbly entreat him by his grace to enable me to keep these Resolutions, so far as they are agreeable to his will, for Christ’s sake."
