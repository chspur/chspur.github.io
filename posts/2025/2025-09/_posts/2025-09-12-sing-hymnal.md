## sing hymnal

Today's prayer meeting was the first time we used the new *Sing Hymnal* by Keith and Kristyn Getty. The church bought a bunch of hardcover copies and we were all very excited to use it. We sang *More Love to Thee* as our first hymn. Although we have already been singing hymns during worship, this is the first time that we've used hymnals at church. It's part of the ongoing effort to reform our church's worship.
