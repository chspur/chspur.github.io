## union with Christ

Read the sixth chapter of *Spiritual Depression* by ML-J today. He is such an outstanding preacher, it's amazing. Every sermon so far has been excellent and this one I just read was no exception. Here's one part that stirred my affections:

> Ultimately it all comes to this, that the real cause of the trouble is failure to realize our union with Christ. Many seem to think that Christianity just means that we are delivered in the sense that our sins are forgiven. But that is only the beginning, but one aspect of it. Essentially salvation means union with Christ, being one with Christ. As we were one with Adam we are now one with Christ. We have been crucified with Christ&mdash;'I am crucified with Christ', says Paul. 'All that has happened to Him has happened to me. I am one with Him.' Read the fifth and sixth chapters of Paul's Epistle to the Romans. The teaching is that we have died with Christ, have been buried with Christ, have risen with Christ, are seated in the heavenly places in Christ and with Christ. That is the teaching of the Scriptures. 'Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God' (Colossians 3:3). THe old man has been crucified and all that belonged to him. His sins have all been dealt with. You are buried with Christ, you are risen with Christ. 'Reckon ye yourselves then to be dead unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord' (Romans 6:11).
