## demon slayer

After work today, Jonk and I got poke for dinner and then we went to watch the new Demon Slayer movie. I gave the movie a 7/10. The fights were good, but there was so much backstory. They would even happen in the middle of the fights. The backstories themselves weren't bad, but most of them were like sob stories and I felt like it was a little overdone. Overall, not a horrible movie and I still enjoyed it.
