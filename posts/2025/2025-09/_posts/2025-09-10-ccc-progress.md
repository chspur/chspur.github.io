## ccc progress

I'm about a third of the way through the *Catechism of the Catholic Church*. I'm almost done with the first section on the Apostles' Creed. It's been pretty much what I've expected. Obviously, there are disagreements on ecclesiology, mariology, the role of tradition, relationship with other religions, and so forth. But, there has been substantial agreement though too, which makes sense because we hold the Apostles' Creed in common. I'm sure once I reach the section on worship there will be much more significant disagreements.
