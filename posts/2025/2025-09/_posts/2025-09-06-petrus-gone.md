## petrus gone

Petrus went back to school today. Dad drove him down around noon.

Finished the book I was reading on the Nicene Creed. It was more of an introductory book, so it wasn't too long of a read. I learned quite a bit from it though. I have another book on the Nicene Creed that I'm planning to start on. Hopefully, I can finish that before the end of this year, since this year is the 1700<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Council of Nicaea.
