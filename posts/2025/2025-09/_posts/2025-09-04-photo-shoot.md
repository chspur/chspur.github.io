## photo shoot

At work today, there was an organized photo shoot for some of our communion products and I was one of the people used in the photos. I was front and central for most of it unfortunately. The owner of our company said (jokingly, but also I believe he really did mean it) that I would bring some diversity to the photo shoot. At least I got free lunch.

After work, I picked up some stuff I ordered online from Uniqlo that I had shipped to their store. It's pretty close to my work place. I got two shirts, one of which was a One Piece shirt with Kuma and Bonney on it.

Called the council again today too. I feel like our calls recently have been quite controversial, but maybe it's always been like this and I just forgot because I don't call them that often anymore.
