## league with trungy

Sleeping late tonight because I ran a couple of games with Trungy. 

I asked the council if they wanted to do a book club together and they agree. We are reading *The Law and the Gospel* by John Colquhoun. The goal is to do a chapter every two weeks, which is quite a reasonable pace.
