## labor day

Had a day off today because of Labor Day. Went swimming in the morning and then we got lunch to celebrate Abelard's birthday. Got a decent chunk of reading done. In the evening, I called the council and played League with the 348 gang too. Sleeping late tonight, but it's fine because this doesn't happen often.
