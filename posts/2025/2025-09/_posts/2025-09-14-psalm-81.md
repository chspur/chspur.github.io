## psalm 81

P Dan preached on Psalm 81 today. It was a good reminder about the importance of worship, sanctifying the Lord's Day, and turning from our idolatry.

There is a boy in CM that always comes up to me to tell me that he read his Bible during the week. He's the cutest kid and I love watching him talk. He's quite the talker too and can go on about random things, which I never mind listening to.

Gave the Children's Catechism flashcards to my students today.

P John bought a cake for me in honor of my birthday. I'm glad and very thankful that I was able to celebrate with the other CM teachers.
