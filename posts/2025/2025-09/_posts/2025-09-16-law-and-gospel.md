## law and gospel

Been reading *A Treatise on the Law and the Gospel* by John Colquhoun. I finished the first chapter ahead of the date that we set, which is this coming Friday. This was a highlight from the first chapter:

> The law as a rule of life to believers, especially in this view of it, is very different from the law as a covenant of works. The precept of the law as a covenant is "Do and live," but the command of the law as a rule is "Live and do"; the law of works says, "Do or you shall be condemned to die," but the law in the hand of Christ says, "You are delivered from condemnation; therefore do." The command of the former is "Do perfectly that you may have a right to eternal life," but that of the latter is, "You already have begun possession of eternal life, as well as the promise of the complete possession of it, therefore do in such a manner as to advance daily toward perfection." By the former, a man is commanded to do in his own strength, but by the latter he is required to do in the strength that is in Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus says to every believer, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9); therefore, do. THe commandments of the law, both as a covenant and as a rule, are materially but are not formally the same.
