## an enjoyable saturday

I got ample amounts of sleep last night, so I was very refreshed and had a wonderful time communing with the Lord. Had an extended time of prayer and was able to pour out my heart before God.

Trung was in the area, so Chen and I were hanging with him for a bit in the afternoon. We went to Jamba Juice because it was national smoothie day today and they had smoothies for a dollar.

In the evening, there was a YA fellowship event at P Justin's house. It was a good time of fellowship. Very grateful for P Justin! He worked so hard and was making burgers for us the entire time. Thankful for Hannah's hospitality as well and her willingness to open up their house to us.
