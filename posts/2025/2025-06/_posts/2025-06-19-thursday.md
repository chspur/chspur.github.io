## thursday 6:02-6:55am

Had good fellowship with God today. Affections were stirred as I gave thanks to Him. Prayed for Dad's upcoming job interview, as well as those going on missions.

Also, today is Charles Spurgeon's birthday! How greatly I benefit from reading his sermons! I am currently on sermon 65.
