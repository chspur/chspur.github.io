## a great day

I had a great day today. It's probably one of the best days I've had in a while. I had a wonderful time of communion with God this morning. I was in Micah 7 and reading Micah 7:18-20 really stirred my affections and moved me to worship the Lord. It is reminiscient of Exodus 34 when God passed by Moses and proclaimed to him His name:

>The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.

I marveled at how God could be so gracious, merciful, kind, forgiving, compassionate, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness despite how sinful I am and continue to be. I mourned and confessed of how little I love Him despite His incomprehensible love towards me. The Lord is truly so wonderful and lovely.
