## jonah

Was reading *Jonah* by O. Palmer Robertson and it ministered to my soul in a wonderful way. Here's a great paragraph:

> If a sinning, selfish, loveless, disobedient servant of the Lord under the Old Testament has such boldness in approaching the very God he has offended, how much more should you approach the throne of grace with boldness? When you are suffering severe chastening from the Lord, admit your wrong and return to him. There you must leave your case. The last thing you want to do is turn inward on yourself and despair. Look up! Look far, far away to the dwelling-place of the Lord. Apply to the objective benefits that can be found in his sovereign mercy alone.
>
> When you observe the way the Lord treated his servant Jonah, you can surely hope. Be ready to turn whenever you stray, whenever you are chastened. Come with a new commitment to submit this time to the Lord's will. Put your entire trust in the mercy of God as it is found in the death of Jesus Christ for rebellious sinners.
