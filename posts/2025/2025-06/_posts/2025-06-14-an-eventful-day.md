## an eventful day

Drove to SD to see 348 gang. Chen and Jonk were going down for gradutation, but I went just to see Trungy. It's been about six months since I last saw him, so I'm glad I was able to hang with him for a bit. We got lunch and dessert.

In the evening, I drove to Irvine for Soowon and Rachel's engagement party. It was a very sweet surprise for Rachel and it was nice seeing all the Kairos guys again.
