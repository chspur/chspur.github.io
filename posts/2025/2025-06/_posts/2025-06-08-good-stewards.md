## good stewards

Today, P Dan gave an important reminder from 1 Peter 4:7-11 about stewarding our spiritual gifts well. I was reminded that I must use my gifts in a way that glorifies God because that is the purpose for which God gave me my gifts. I do this by using my gifts to build up the body of Christ and serving in the strength that He provides.
