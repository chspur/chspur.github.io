## concordia

Bought some books from Concordia today. Not Concordia Supply, the company I work for, but Concordia Publishing House. I think at some point in the past they were connected. Anyways, I bought a two volume set of Martin Luther's sermons on the gospels, as well as a copy of the Lutheran confessions.
