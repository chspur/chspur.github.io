## confessional lutheranism

Started reading the Book of Concord at work today. It's funny because I work for Concordia Supply and they used to be a Lutheran company. So far, the book has been excellent and I highly respect the importance they place on confessional Christianity. Here is one of my favorite parts from the introduction. Replace the Lutheran theology with Reformed and I would completely affirm what they had to say:

> Rev. Dr. C. F. W. Walther explained how important the Book of Concord is for all Lutherans.
>
> The Book of Concord should be in every Lutheran home. For that reason our Church should provide a good, inexpensive copy, and pastors should see to it that every home has one. . . . If a person isn't familiar with this book, he'll think, "That hold book is just for pastors. I don't have to preach. After working all day, I can't sit down and study in the evening. If I read my morning and evening devotions, that's enough." No, that is not enough! The Lord doesn't want us to remain children, who are blown to and fro by every wind of doctrine; instead of that, He wants us to grow in knowledge so that we can teach others.
