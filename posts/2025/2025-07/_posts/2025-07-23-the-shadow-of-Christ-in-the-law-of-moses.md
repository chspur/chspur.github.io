## the shadow of Christ in the law of moses

I started reading *The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses* by Vern Poythress. It's the next book in the Reformed Forum reading plan I'm using. Hope I can continue to make good progress on that reading plan. There's a lot of books on that list, many of which are quiet tough to read. *The Shadow of Christ* has been very interesting so far though. I'm currently learning about the tabernacle.
