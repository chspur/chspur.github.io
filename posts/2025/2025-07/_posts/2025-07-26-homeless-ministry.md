## homeless ministry

Went to GMC's homeless ministry for the first time today. It's pretty similar to LTN back when I was in Kairos. We sang a song, P Justin gave a short message, and we served food and ate with them. It was cool talking to them. I was reminded of how gracious the Lord has been in my life.
