## tuesday 5:57-6:50am

Had a wonderful time with the Lord this morning. It was especially good today, which is something I haven't experienced in a while. Was caught up in the greatness of who He is and the kindness of what He has done for me. I prayed for P Dan and P Justin as they will be in Mexico for their mission trip this week. Also prayed for the little ones.
