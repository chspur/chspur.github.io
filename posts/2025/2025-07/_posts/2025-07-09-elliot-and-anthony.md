## elliot and anthony

Went to a Thai place in Chino Hills for dinner with Elliot and Anthony. It was pretty good. After, we went to the Meet Fresh next door and I got a drink. It was fun hanging out with them. I learned a lot about GMC and Soon. I was encouraged to hear about their passion for the doctrines of grace and biblical worship songs. It's refreshing to see their conviction and willingness to stand for the truth.
