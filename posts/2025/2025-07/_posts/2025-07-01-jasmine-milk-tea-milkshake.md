## jasmine milk tea milkshake

Got dinner with Chen and Jonk today. Jonk wanted to get a meal together before he goes back to school. We went to this new hot pot place in Victoria Gardens and then after we got ice cream. I got a jasmine milk tea milkshake, which was really good, but my stomach definitely regretted it after.
