## time well spent

I skipped my routine morning shower today because I felt like my hair looked good enough. That saved me around fifteen minutes, which I was able to spend in prayer. It was time well spent with the Lord. I prayed for my fellow CM teachers.

John MacArthur passed away today. Truly a great man has fallen this day in Israel.
