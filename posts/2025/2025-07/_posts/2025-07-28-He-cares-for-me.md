## He cares for me

This past Lord's Day, P Dan preached a wondeful sermon on 1 Peter 5:5-7. It was about humbling ourselves before God, which one does through prayer. Humility and prayerfulness are probably the two things I am most lacking in, so this was a timely reminder from the Lord. Verse 7 is such an amazing truth. O blessed thought, He cares for me, He cares for me, He cares for someone like me!
