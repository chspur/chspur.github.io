## summer overcast

There was an overcast today even though it's still summer. I put on sunscreen before I went swimming, though I probably didn't need it because of how cloudy it was. The weather is quite strange sometimes. It created a nice vibe during my swim though. Large clouds, a few drops of rain, and the sun peaking through. There was barely anyone at the pool too, so it was very relaxing.
