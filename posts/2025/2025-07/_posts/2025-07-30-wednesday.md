## wednesday 5:42-6:47am

This morning I had great communion with God again. I'm not sure why, but I've been naturally waking up 10-15 minutes before my alarm goes off, so I've been able to have more time for private worship in the morning than I usually have. I also haven't been feeling as tired in the morning as I usually do. I think both of those factors have been contributing to my deeper fellowship with the Lord these past two days. I've been able to pour out my heart in prayer, filled with a strange sense of joy and love to God. Prayed for P Justin and P Dan, Dad's upcoming interview, and the CM teachers.
