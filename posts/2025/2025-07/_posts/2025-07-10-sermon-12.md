## sermon 12

Been making good progress on *Grace and Glory*. I only have four sermons left. Sermon 12 was a glorious exposition of Hebrews 13:8. Here was one of my favorite parts:

> No - the sympathy of Christ works for us with all the endless resources that his divine nature and his glorious humanity put at its disposal. It is the sympathy of one who is the same yesterday and today and for ever; of one who remembers, as only absolutely perfect human nature can remember, what he himself passed through while on earth, when he offered prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears. It is the sympathy of one with whom to feel for us and to act upon us is one and the same thing. It is the sympathy of one who has access at every moment to every part of any distressing or perplexing situation in which any believer may find himself as well as to every recess of our heart, to the most secret fears and the most silent griefs which we can share with nobody else. And then it is the sympathy of one who can never grow weary of our complaints because in him there is an inexhaustible store of pity which is adequate for the consolation of ages of believers, which flows as freely now for you and me as it flowed in the day of the Hebrew Christians, for the simple reason that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever, unchangeable in this as in everything else. It is only by thus uniting the divine and the human, the temporal and the eternal aspect of Christ's activity for us that we can draw from them that rich profit and consolation which the reading of this wonderful epistle is intended to supply to us.
