## goodbye dust jackets

Took all the dust jackets off my books today. I didn't want to throw them away, so I just stored them in a box. I think I prefer the look of my hardcover books without their dust jackets. For the books I own, the design of the dust jackets aren't that great, maybe because I mostly own Christian books. They also get in the way when I read. Originally, I would take them off when I read and put them back on when they are on the bookshelf, but now I don't use them at all, so we'll see how that goes.
