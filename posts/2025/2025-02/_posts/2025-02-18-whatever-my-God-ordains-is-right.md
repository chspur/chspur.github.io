## whatever my God ordains is right

> Whate'er my God ordains is right:
>
> his holy will abideth;
>
> I will be still, whate'er he doth,
>
> and follow where he guideth.
>
> He is my God; though dark my road,
>
> he holds me that I shall not fall:
>
> wherefore to him I leave it all.
>
> Whate'er my God ordains is right:
>
> he never will deceive me;
>
> he leads me by the proper path;
>
> I know he will not leave me.
>
> I take, content, what he hath sent;
>
> his hand can turn my griefs away,
>
> and patiently I wait his day.
>
> Whate'er my God ordains is right:
>
> though now this cup, in drinking,
>
> may bitter seem to my faint heart,
>
> I take it, all unshrinking.
>
> My God is true; each morn anew
>
> sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart,
>
> and pain and sorrow shall depart.
>
> Whate'er my God ordains is right:
>
> here shall my stand be taken;
>
> though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
>
> yet am I not forsaken.
>
> My Father's care is round me there;
>
> he holds me that I shall not fall:
>
> and so to him I leave it all.
