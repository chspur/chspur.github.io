## He leads the humble

> <sup>8</sup> Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. <sup>9</sup> He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way. <sup>10</sup> All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.

—Psalm 25:8-10
