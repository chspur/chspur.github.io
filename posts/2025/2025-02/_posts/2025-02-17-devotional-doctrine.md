## devotional doctrine

This quote accurately reflects my own experience (besides the part about a pipe lol). I did not really have any devotion at all until I began learning doctrine.

> For my own part I tend to find the doctrinal books often more helpful in devotion than the devotional books, and I rather suspect that the same experience may await many others. I believe that many who find that "nothing happens" when they sit down, or kneel down, to a book of devotion, would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand.

—C. S. Lewis, *Preface to On the Incarnation*
