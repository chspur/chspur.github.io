## first job

The interview went well and I was told that I got the job! This will be my first full-time job, so I'm very excited about it and grateful to God for His gracious provision. Thank you Lord!

We had prayer meeting at church tonight and after we ate some ice cream together. I enjoyed praying as usual and also the fellowship with brothers and sisters.
