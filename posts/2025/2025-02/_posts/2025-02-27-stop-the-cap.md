## stop the cap

I'm on Episode 967 of One Piece. No way the Whitebeard Pirates went HEAD TO HEAD with the Roger Pirates bro. This was even when Whitebeard was younger too and presumably his crew was weaker at that time than at Marineford. Come on bro, stop the cap. Rayleigh alone could have wiped all of Whitebeard's commanders.
