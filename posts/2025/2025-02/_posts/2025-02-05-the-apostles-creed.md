## the apostles' creed

We recited the Apostles' Creed this past Lord's Day. I always recite it loudly and proudly because there's something so awesome about being able to confess the wonderful and foundational truths of the Christian faith that are contained in the creed. It's amazing to think that Christians around the world and throughout history have confessed these same words and that I get to be part of that great tradition. What an immense privilege it is to be able to join in with the great cloud of witnesses that have gone before me, as well as my brothers and sisters in Christ today, when I confess the Apostles' Creed.
