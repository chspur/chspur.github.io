## much forgiven

Today, P Dan preached a very convicting sermon on Luke 7:36-50, the story of the sinful woman who was forgiven much. The main point of the sermon was that the more you understand how much you have been forgiven, the more you will love Christ. I need to guard my heart from being satisfied with just a minimal relationship with Christ. I need to be very careful about whether I'm giving just enough to keep my conscious quiet. I also need to regulary study how much I have been forgiven by God, so I do not become ungrateful and lose my love for God.

I had an interesting thought after the sermon as I was driving home. I think the more I understand all the grace I've received in general, the more I will love Christ. Forgiveness of my sins is definitely one of those graces, but there is so much more that Christ has given me and understanding all of that to a greater extent is will make me love Christ more. He's given me His righteousness, freedom from sin and power over sin, adoption into His family, hope of heaven, eternal life, communion with God, and so much more. These are all reasons to be grateful towards Christ and things I should be constantly reminding myself of lest I forget.
