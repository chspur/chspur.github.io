## regular times

Went swimming today. My normal sets are pretty easy now. Maybe I need to increase the amount again. Unfortunately, I won't be able to swim at my regular times after I start work, so I'm going to try to go in the evenings. Also, I bought some shirts today that I'm planning on wearing to work.
