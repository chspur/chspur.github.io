## an interesting group

I had dinner at Diane's house with Jadon and Chen. We ate hotpot and it was delicious, as expected. I also had creme brulee for the first time. It was an interesting group because usually 348 gang and the council don't hang out together. Diane wanted to talk to Chen and practice her hospitality skills though, so that's why it happened. It was fun and I had a good time.
