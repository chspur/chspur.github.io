## the power of prayer

What power is given to us in the great privilege of prayer! My desire is to be skilled in the use of this power and to use it to the full measure of honoring God.

> Few Christians have anything but a vague idea of the power of prayer; fewer still have any experience of that power. The Church seems almost wholly unaware of the power God puts into her hand; this spiritual *carte blanche* on this infinite resources of God's wisdom and power is rarely, if ever, used—never used to the full measure of honoring God. It is astounding how poor the use, how little the benefits. Prayer is our most formidable weapon, but the one in which we are the least skilled, the most averse to its use. We do everything else for the heathen save the thing God wants us to do; the only thing which does any good—makes all we do efficient.

—E. M. Bounds, *Purpose in Prayer*
