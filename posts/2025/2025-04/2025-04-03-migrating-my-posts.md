## migrating my posts

Just went to work today, nothing special. Making a few changes on my blog and planning on doing some reading after.

If this post works, I'm going to migrate all my posts.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>daily reading</summary>

| {{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }} |
| :-------------: |
| [1 Kings 4â€“5; Eph. 2; Ezek. 35; Ps. 85]({% link _Bible/Bible-year-1.md %}) |
| [WCF 8; WLC 51-56; WSC 29-32]({% link _westminster/westminster-month-3.md %}) |
| [The Nicene Creed](https://threeforms.org/the-nicene-creed/) |
