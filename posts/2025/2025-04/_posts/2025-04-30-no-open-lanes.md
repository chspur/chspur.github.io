## no open lanes

Today was the first time there were no open lanes when I got to the pool. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait that long before a lane opened up. I swam 1900 meters today. Recently, I've been starting with 400 meters of breastroke, which have been making my workouts more tiring, but it's been good exercise.
