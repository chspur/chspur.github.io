## chen birthday

Celebrated Chen's birthday today with Jonk. His birthday is technically tomorrow, but he's going to a retreat tomorrow, so we celebrated today. The three of us ate at a Peruvian restaurant that Jonk recommended. It was pretty good. We walked around Barnes and Nobles after. It was cool catching up with them and trading cards in TCG Pocket. I also bought Chen a cool Sukuna funko pop for his birthday gift.
