## resurrection sunday

P Dan preached today from 1 Peter 3:15 on the glorious hope that we have as Christians. It was a moving sermon that made me long to be with Christ, in Heaven, and able to see His glory.

For dinner, I tried cooking steak for the first time. It was overcooked and too salty. My goal is to practice until I can cook a good steak.

I also finished sermon 45 of Calvin's sermons on Ephesians. Only three more to go.
