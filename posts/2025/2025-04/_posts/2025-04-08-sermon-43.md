## sermon 43

I finished sermon 43 today. Only five more to go. I remember, when I started the book, that I used to think it was hard to read Calvin. Now that I'm towards the end, it's definitely way easier and I read a lot faster now that I've gotten use to his style. The translation work is excellent, so that definitely helps a lot too.
