## laker game

Was hanging out with Chen and Jonk for most of today. We went to Pinwheel Pasta again for lunch and a Mexican ice cream place after. In the evening, we watched the Laker game at Jonk's house while eating some Wing Stop. We also played some Slay the Spire and Nintendo Switch Sports. It was a fun day and kind of rare that we got to spend so much time together.
