## swim struggles

Ran into some minor struggles as I went swimming today. First, I was one of the last ones out of the office, so I didn't have time to change in the bathroom because they were locking up already. I ended up changing in my car, but I think, starting next week, I might try to start my work day earlier because then I could get off earlier as well. After, my wallet fell out of my pocket in the car and I didn't realize until I was in the locker room already, so I had to go all the way back out to get it because I was worried I lost it.
