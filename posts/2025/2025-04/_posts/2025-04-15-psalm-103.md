## psalm 103

> <sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him...

> <sup>17</sup> But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him...

Was very blessed by Psalm 103 today during my devos. It's truly so amazing that God loves me the way He does.
