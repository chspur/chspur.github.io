## swimming in the rain

When I left for the Claremont Club today, it was barely raining. By the time I got there, it was raining super hard and I only had a t-shirt, shorts, and sandals on. I was already there though, so the rain didn't stop me. It doesn't make much difference anyway since I was going there to swim.

In the afternoon, we went to pick up my new suit. It fits well and I think I look really good in it.

Halfway through *What It Means To Be Protestant* by Gavin Ortlund. A good read so far. Learning more about Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and their differences with Protestantism.
