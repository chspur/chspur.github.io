## limited edition sproul

My copy of the *Holiness of God* by R. C. Sproul finally came in the mail today. I got the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary limited edition, which is super cool. It took a while to get here because the first copy they sent actually got lost by the post office, so they had to ship another one to me. Very glad and thankful I finally got it though. I've read a decent amount of Reformed theology, but I still haven't read this classic, which is kind of shocking to me.
