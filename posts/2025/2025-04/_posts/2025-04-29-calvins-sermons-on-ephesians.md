## calvin's sermons on ephesians

Just finished sermon 48, which is the last sermon Calvin's sermons on Ephesians. I started on October 8, 2024, so it took me a little more than half a year to finish the whole thing. Definitely an edifying read. If anyone says that Calvin wouldn't have believed what later Calvinists believed, I would recommend them to read his sermons on Ephesians. I love how when I read his sermons I can hear him preaching. I can imagine him preaching in the pulpit, expounding the Word to the congregation. It's interesting because I feel this when I read the sermons of other powerful preachers, like Spurgeon. It's why I enjoy reading sermons so much.
