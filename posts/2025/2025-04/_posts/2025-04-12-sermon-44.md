## sermon 44

Finished sermon 44 of Calvin's sermons on Ephesians. Only four more left to go. I also finished the biography of Calvin that I was reading. His life was just incredible.

Redownloaded Hearthstone and played a couple of games. Now that I make money I could definitely pick it back up again, but I just don't think I have the time.
