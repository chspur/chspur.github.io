## dinner with chen

Got kbbq and boba with Chen after work today. It felt like I haven't talked to him in a while, so it was nice catching up with him.

Also, today was the first day I started work at eight in the morning. Still trying to decide if I want to start at eight or seven-thirty, but I think I'm going to try eight this week and see how it goes.
