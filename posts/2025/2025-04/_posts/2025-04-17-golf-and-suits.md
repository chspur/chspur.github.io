## golf and suits

We ended work at noon today and had a company event at Top Golf. Everything was paid for, including food, which was great. I enjoyed playing and am very grateful.

After, Mom, Dad, and I went to shop for a suit for me to wear to Diane's wedding. The owner of the store who was helping us was very friendly and gave top-tier service. We bought a nice suit for a good price and I'm very happy with it.
