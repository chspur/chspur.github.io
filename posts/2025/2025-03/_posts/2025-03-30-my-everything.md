## my everything

P Dan preached a powerful sermon on 1 Peter 3:13-17 today. In our suffering, we are commanded not to fear and to set apart Christ as Lord in our hearts. I was reminded that Christ must be my everything. Every part of my life must be with Christ, in Christ, pleasing to Christ, and done for the glory of Christ. All of life must be for God.

I was very moved during the sermon. I can tell that P Dan really loves us by the way he would exhort us during the sermon. Oh, that I would truly know how much Christ loves me, so that He would be my everything.
