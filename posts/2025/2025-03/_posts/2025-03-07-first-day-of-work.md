## first day of work

Today was my first day of work. I was mostly shadowing the other people on my team. The sandwich I made for lunch was really good.

I need to readjust my schedule now that I'm working. I still want to wake up in the morning to do my devos, so that means I have to start sleeping really early. I also have to start swimming after work now. Hopefully, it's not gonna be too crowded at the pool, but we'll see.
