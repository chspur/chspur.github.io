## on the phones

I've started my time on the phones. I'll only be there for two weeks, so I got it enjoy it while it lasts I guess. It's not easy helping customers. Whenever I don't know how to do something, I'm like a deer in the headlights.

Went swimming today. It started raining towards the end of my swim and it was pretty cold when I got out.
