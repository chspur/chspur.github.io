## no harmless thing

Today, P Dan preached from Mark 5:1-20. The enemy wants to destroy us completely and cannot be subdued by human strength. However, our Lord Jesus is able to quickly subdue the enemy with His strength. It was an important reminder for me that sin is no harmless thing. Just like how the demon-possessed man was cutting himself with stones, every sin we commit damages our souls, which is why the enemy tempts us to sin.
