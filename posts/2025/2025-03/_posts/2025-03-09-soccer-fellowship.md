## soccer fellowship

Today P Dan preached on 1 Peter 3:1-7. It was a very bold sermon on the submission of wives to their husbands. It helped me better understand what kind of woman I should seek to marry.

After church, we had a soccer fellowship event. It was fun, but also very tiring. I ran more than I had in the last six months and got multiple cramps. I'm definitely not in running condition.
