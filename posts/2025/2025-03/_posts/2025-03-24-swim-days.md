## swim days

I'm on a tight schedule on swim days. After work, I go straight to swim, then I go home and eat dinner, after I got to do my devos, and then I basically have to sleep. I'm so tired right now because I didn't sleep as much as I normally do last night, plus work and swim, got me so tired.
