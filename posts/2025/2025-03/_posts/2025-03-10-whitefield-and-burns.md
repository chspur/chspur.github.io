## whitefield and burns

Started training today at work. It was chill and actually pretty interesting. I'm super sore from soccer yesterday, so I didn't go swimming after work like I had planned.

My Banner of Truth order came in today. Got Arnold Dallimore's two-volume biography of George Whitefield and another book titled *The Pastor of Kilsyth*, a biography of William H. Burns.
