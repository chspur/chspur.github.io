## all staff meeting

Had my first all staff meeting at work today. I introduced myself as one of the new hires and various people gave updates on the stuff they are responsible for. They also do this thing where if it's your birthday or anniversary, you can spin a wheel for some rewards. There were a decent amount of people with birthdays or anniversaries so the wheel was spun a couple of times.
