## bacio di latte

Chen, Jonk, and I went out for lunch today. For lunch, we ate American BBQ at a restuarant in Victoria Gardens and then we got gelato after. The gelato was pretty good, but also pretty expensive. Chen was showing us all the great food he ate in China. He also got me a bookmark from the Hubei Museum. Was fun hanging out with them.
