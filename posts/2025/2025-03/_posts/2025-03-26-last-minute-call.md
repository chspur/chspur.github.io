## last minute call

Today I got a call literally two minutes before I was suppose to end work, so I ended up having to do some overtime. The most troll thing about it was that her credit card declined in the end, so we couldn't even place her order after all the time we spent trying to do that. It's ok. Stuff like this happens and it was a funny experience.
