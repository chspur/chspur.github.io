## early bird

In Guatemala, I always started my day early with morning prayer at 5:30. I wanted to continue that when I came back, but it's so hard to sleep early because my family doesn't eat dinner early enough and naturally my schedule kind of follows their schedule too. I've settled with starting my day at 7, but these last couple of days I've been waking up later and later, so I got to fix that.

I think I'm going to try waking up at 6:30, just so I'm not so rushed to do my devos on mornings when I have to leave for swim at 9.
