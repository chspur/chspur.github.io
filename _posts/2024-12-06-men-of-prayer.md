## men of prayer

Another quote from J. C. Ryle's *A Call to Prayer*. This one encourages me to imitate the prayerfulness of faithful saints in history. My prayer and greatest desire is that God would make me a man of prayer like those saints.

> Look through the lives of the brightest and best of God's servants, whether in the Bible or not. See what is written of Moses and David and Daniel and Paul. Mark what is recorded of Luther and Bradford, the Reformers. Observe what is related of the private devotions of Whitefield and Cecil and Venn and Bickersteth and M'Cheyne. Tell me of one of all the goodly fellowship of saints and martyrs, who has not had this mark most prominently - he was ***a man of prayer***. Depend upon it, prayer is power. 
>
> Prayer obtains fresh and continued outpourings of the Spirit. He alone begins the work of grace in a man's heart. He alone can carry it forward and make it prosper. But the good Spirit loves to be entreated. And those who ask most will have most of his influence.

-J. C. Ryle, *A Call to Prayer*
