## garmin swim 2

I bought the Garmin Swim 2 recently and tried it for the first time today. It's pretty good. Records accurately and syncs with Strava. I swam 2150 meters and wanted to do some breastroke after that, but after 100 meters I had a cramp in my leg so I decided to call it a day. Been swimming for more than six months now since I started the 25<sup>th</sup> of May and I don't think I've ever been more built in my life. My shoulders, back, and triceps are bigger now than when I used to go to the gym. Swimming has also made my left arm and shoulder more balanced with my right, whereas before my right side was noticeably bigger because it's my dominant side. I guess that makes sense since when I swim I use both arms and shoulders equally.
