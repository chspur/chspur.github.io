## calvinism debunked

Had very sweet communion with God this morning during my devotional time. Not sure how to describe it, but it was different from other days and I could tell. I felt very near to God while I was praying and reading His word. My mind was relatively free from distractions and I had such a real sense of God in my heart while I was meditating on who He is and what He has done for me. I was just filled with praise and thanksgiving and love towards God, and I felt so refreshed after I finished and motivated to serve the Lord more wholeheartedly.

At BSF today, part of our discussion included 2 Peter 3:9 and our group leader, Ron, said something along the lines of how this verse throws Calvinism out the window. He said it in a light-hearted way, but you can understand the gist of what he was trying to say. I didn't say anything, but I thought it was interesting that he thought one verse can debunk, at the very least, 500 years of Reformed theology. Funny how God works though because after class he happened to ask me about what church I attend and he seemed a little flustered when he realized that I'm Presbyterian, a firm five point Calvinist, and really into Reformed theology.
