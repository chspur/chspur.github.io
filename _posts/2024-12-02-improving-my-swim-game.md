## improving my swim game

Swimming 200 meters consecutively has gotten a lot easier, so I increased it to 300 for the last two intervals today and ended up swimming around 2200 meters. Also bought the Garmin Swim 2 today so I really be improving my swim game.

I was talking to a granny before swimming and she thought I was in high school. I told her I graduated from college already and she thought that I was a genius and skipped some grades until I told her I'm 23. Not even surprised because I sort of get this a lot and I do look like a kid to be honest, but it's fine because I'll look like I'm 25 when I turn 30.
